# Transposed_Convolutional_Networks
The implementation is based on the paper "Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation", which introduces transposed convolutional neural networks published in CVPR 2015.

The implementation uses tensorflow and Caltech data. The data can be downloaded from the website https://data.caltech.edu/records/20086

Download the data and rename the folder to data. Arrange the data in the following manner.
